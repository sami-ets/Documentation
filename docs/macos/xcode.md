# Xcode

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is an integrated development environment for macOS containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS.

Download and install it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

For Git tools, you will need to install Xcode command line tools.

After downloading and installing Xcode from the App Store, install the Xcode command line tools. Run:

$ xcode-select --install
It'll prompt you to install the command line tools. Follow the instructions and you'll have Xcode and Xcode command line tools both installed.
