# Intership and new members

If you are a new intern into the lab, you should consider following these general guidelines. These are based on 
previous internship experience and supervision.   


## Python programming

New interns *must* know how to program in Python language. Python programming language is mandatory in machine learning.
You should also be familiar with common scientific libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, Pandas and Scikit-Learn. Common
design patterns and object oriented programming concepts should be known by the intern.

If you feel you don't comply with these basic programming skills, following a crash course on either of these 
subjects will definitively be a good thing and will help you a lot in the near future. There are also a few books 
which you can read for getting familiar with applied machine learning with Python. Don't try to skip these steps 
and go directly into your project. Basic programming concepts and skills like using libraries and using library
documentation should be mastered prior working on your project, especially in applied machine learning.


## Getting familiar with in-house libraries

If you are now confident with your programming skills and software engineering concepts, you are now ready to explore
the libraries we developed in the lab. These are [Kerosene](https://github.com/banctilrobitaille/kerosene/tree/master/kerosene)
and [SAMITorch](https://github.com/sami-ets/SAMITorch). Documentation of both library is still a work in progress, but
you should be able to use them quickly. While Kerosene is a PyTorch wrapper for accelerating research code development,
SAMITorch is more applied to medical imaging using Numpy and PyTorch Tensors. Knowing how to use PyTorch library is 
now mandatory once you get to this step.

Your code will likely use Kerosene and SAMITorch. Knowing how to work with these Python libraries will ease and 
accelerate your work, will make you avoid mistakes and will give you all the tools to succeed in your project. You 
can also participate to their development by proposing and implementing new features by creating a Github Issue or 
submitting a Pull Request. We would like all members to participate in the development of these libraries and use them
in their research project. These libraries lie on solid software engineering concepts and are built with strong 
software quality in mind. They also force the user to code more intelligently and more efficiently to achieve better
results sooner.


## Don't skip steps and do the right things

One of the previous lab interns skipped a lot of steps, focusing only on getting the work published and failing at 
understanding and mastering basic machine learning concepts and software engineering skills. This rendered her work
practically unusable by other members of the lab, isolating herself with her project, rendering it impossible to 
troubleshoot and debug by others. It took a lot of time for another members to take over her work. This could have
been avoid if using our lab's software stack and mastering basic programming skills. This render other members 
inefficient at completing work when you are leaving the lab, especially if your work is near of being publishing.
Coding with the developed libraries (Kerosene and SAMITorch) known by other members creates a coding and developing 
standard in the lab, helping every other member understanding quickly your code and debug way more easily in case you 
need help. We also eventually want these libraries be released and used in other research labs of ETS and this begins
by using and promoting the libs.

Skipping steps in your personal knowledge of machine learning is also risky. To master your project, you must master
your expertise. 

Starting a project during your first week of internship might not be the best idea. Your understanding of your project
and problematic might not be enough at this point to dive directly into your project. Take the necessary time to do a
literature review and to master the concepts underneath the problem you are aiming to solve. Instead of coding right 
away in your personal project, writing small code modules into SAMITorch or Kerosene that you know you are going to need 
in the future is a better starting point. This code is going to be reviewed by the libraries' authors and will for sure 
require some adjustments, which are integral parts of your learning curve and adaptation. You will also have to write
unit and/or integration tests when supplying your code. Writing these tests will ensure you don't make mistakes at the
very beginning of your work, which could potentially save you an enormous amount of time all along your 
internship/master/Ph.D degree.


## It will take time

Writing clean code and tests obviously take more time than not caring about those points. Software quality is usually 
directly proportional to the amount of time you took at cleaning your code and writing relevant tests for it. You will
feel you are not moving forward enough quickly for teachers or not delivering things into expect time frame. This is 
totally normal and you should not worry about this. Teacher always underestimate the effort you spend during the coding
phase of your project. Sometimes many trial and errors has to be done before achieving a publishable grade work. These 
try naturally takes time and this is totally normal. You need to convince yourself that the time you spend on testing
and clean coding will potentially save you a very large amount of time in the future and will permit all the other
members to help you if needed.
