# Working in the lab

The SAMI Lab (ETS main building A-3413) is a small lab in which we want to have friendly relationship with each other
members. 


## Coffee

We have a coffee machine using Keurig's K-Cup. We usually buy these pods at Costco since it's generally less expensive 
and then split the price and the amount of pods equally between the lab's members who drink coffee. If you want to join 
and drink coffee, please inform the members so we could plan to go to Costco (if the flavor you want is available at 
Costco) or bring your own coffee pods.


## Printer

We have a printer available to lab's member. You only have to bring your blank sheets of paper in order to print.
