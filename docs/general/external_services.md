# Github

The lab has it's own Github organisation called [SAMI-ETS](https://github.com/sami-ets).

# Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a powerful business-oriented messaging app. We use it a lot in the lab for collaborating,
sharing information and when working remotely.

The lab's URL is: `shape-lab.slack.com`. 

Please ask any current member of the lab to get an invitation to access Slack.


# Continuous development

We use [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous development and integration. For Github educational accounts, 
there is no build limit. You can use this service for any of your personal repository. 

Since SAMI-ETS is a Github organisation, repository in this organisation have a build limit. 


# Overleaf

When writing paper, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is the tool we use to write in LaTeX and collaborate with 
teachers. Register with your institutional ETS email to get free access.
